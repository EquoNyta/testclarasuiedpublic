Dear participant,

I am rejecting your submission to my study "Influence of sound lateralization in multi-talkers situations".

It seems that you had a problem with your headphones or that these do not allow our experiments to be carried out.

Please contact me if you wish to contest this rejection.

Apologies and regards,
IRBA auditory perception team
